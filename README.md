# MNIST-Dataset-to-Implement-Generative-Adversarial-Networks
About Dataset: The MNIST Dataset is a well-known collection of handwritten digit images from 0 to 9 in grayscale,
each measuring 28 by 28 pixels. And the MNIST dataset has a total of 60000 images of these tiny square images.
Our aim is to train the Discriminator Model with MNIST dataset and with some Noise and after providing some sample noise
same as MNIST to Generator model to generate the same information as MNIST dataset that gives feels exactly or original images
but are actually generated by Generator model.
